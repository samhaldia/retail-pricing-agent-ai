Agentic AI Retail Optimizer
ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Agentic AI Retail Optimizer is a demonstration of a modern, cloud-native application designed to revolutionize retail pricing and promotion strategies. It leverages intelligent AI agents, serverless architecture on AWS, and real-time data processing to provide dynamic price recommendations and personalized promotional ideas. This project showcases how AI-driven automation can enhance business agility and profitability in the retail sector.

---

âœ¨ Features
This application provides the following core functionalities:

Dynamic Product Dashboard: A real-time overview of product inventory, current prices, and key metrics.

Automated Agent Workflow Trigger: Initiate a full cycle of AI agents (market data ingestion, demand forecasting, promotion strategy, price sync) with a single click.

Intelligent Price Recommendations: Generates data-driven price adjustments for products based on market conditions, inventory levels, and demand forecasts.

AI-Powered Promotion Idea Generation: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) via Amazon Bedrock to create creative and targeted promotional campaign ideas for specific products and customer segments.

Recommendation Management: View and apply pending price recommendations directly from the UI, simulating real-world price updates.

Real-time Data Sync (Simulated): The RealTimePriceSyncAgent simulates updating an external e-commerce system with new prices, and logs these actions.

Cloud-Native Architecture: Built on AWS serverless technologies for scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.


Architecture and Structure
The project is structured into a frontend (React), a local Python backend (Flask acting as a local API Gateway/orchestrator), and several AWS cloud services that the local backend interacts with.
